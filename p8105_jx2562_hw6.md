## Problem 1

Load library and dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
homicides <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Filter the data:

1.  Create two new variables `city_state` and `solved`.

2.  Ignore some data points with bad quality

3.  Ensure the `victim_age` variable as numeric variable and omit NAs.

``` r
homicides = homicides |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |>
  mutate(solved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1)) |>
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")  &
           (victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")))) |>
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) |>
  drop_na(victim_age)
```
